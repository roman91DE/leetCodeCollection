# LeetCode Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode challenges, primarily written in Go.

## Getting Started

To run any solution, ensure you have [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install). Clone this repository and navigate to the desired challenge folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roman91DE/leetCodeCollection.git
cd leetCode/<LEARN_PLAN_DIR>/<PROBLEM_DIR>
```

Run the solution with:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized with a directory for each study plan. Within the `top_interview_150` folder, each problem has its own subdirectory named with the problem number and challenge name. Each subdirectory contains the Go solution (`main.go`) and the module file (`go.mod`).
